## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Firebase Offline Errors:**
- **Problem**: `Could not reach Cloud Firestore backend` or `Failed to get document because the client is offline`
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - App now works in offline mode with cached data
- **Why**: Firebase automatically caches data locally when offline

### **Country Search Not Working:**
- **Problem**: Searching "India" or other countries doesn't show results
- **Solution**: ✅ **FIXED** - Added 40+ countries and improved search logic
- **Features**: Search by country name, country code (+91), or just numbers (91)

### **CORS Errors on Web:**
- **Problem**: `Cross-Origin Request Blocked`
- **Solution**: Use mobile app instead of web browser
- **Why**: WhatsApp integration requires mobile environment

### **OTP Not Received:**
- **Check Terminal 1**: OTP appears in console during testing
- **Check Phone Number**: Ensure it includes country code
- **Check WhatsApp**: Make sure WhatsApp is installed and active

### **Auto-Reply Not Working:**
- **Check Terminal 1**: Look for incoming message logs
- **Verify Setup**: Ensure phone number is verified
- **Test Keywords**: Try exact keywords like "hi" or "thanks"

### **Server Not Starting:**
- **Check Ports**: Make sure 3001 and 3002 are available
- **Check Dependencies**: Run `npm install` if needed
- **Check Logs**: Look at terminal output for error messages
