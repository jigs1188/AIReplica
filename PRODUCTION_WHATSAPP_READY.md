## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTES

- **WhatsApp Web sessions expire** if inactive for too long (re-scan QR if needed)
- **Phone must be online** occasionally to keep the session alive

### For SHA-1 Fingerprint (Android):
- âœ… **Already created** with `eas credentials`
- âœ… **Used for**: Google OAuth, Firebase Auth
